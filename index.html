		<h2>The context of Finture</h2>

		Let's start with renewed investments. Investments scare us but we have no rational reason to fear them. On the contrary, they're there for you, to help your money to grow. Only a few people have managed to find the keys to long-term investing. With Finture, our aim is to give you these keys through investment advice and a clear interface for following financial news and automating your finances.
